      <h5>Jenni from the Block</h5>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <p> Jenni Birsan, a 23 year old aspiring rapper, began her career at the young age of 19. She has pursued the
            Special Education sector, and worked one-on-one with high school students with special needs for 2 years,
            teaching them fine-motor skills to help propel them into the workforce. Additionally, she obtained a career
            in the non-for-profit sector for 4 years.</p>

          <p>Throughout her career and undergrad years, she was also contract hired to work for the Illinois Restaurant
            Association in the Chicago Gourmet department, where she helped coordinate Chicago's only premier food and
            wine festival in 2016 and 2017. She currently is working as a content manager and is the liasion between an
            author here in Chicago and a well-known ghostwriter in New York City.</p>

          <p>Her work was all focused one aspect: people. Whether through teaching, giving back to the community, or
            throwing lavish events for entertainment, she excels in all environments.</p>

          <p>Now, she is ready for a new challenge. Her most recent project and role was heavily involved in consulting,
            strategic operations, and content management. She is eager to learn all the ins and outs of web development
            and wants to expand her skill set constantly. Some of her top projects include <a
              href="https://yzhouyzhou.github.io/team6-project1/">What's Up, Chicago?</a>, <a
              href="https://jennibirsan.github.io/Train-Activity/">Train Timer</a>, and <a
              href="https://jennibirsan.github.io/unit-4-game/">TMNT Guessing Game</a>. However, she still dreams of
            becoming a rapper. One day. You will see. Jenni is also a big fan of Tupac and believes he is still alive.
